# Optional local source conversions

These tools convert locally supplied Nintendo Mario Kart 8 models. The source artwork is not original OpenWii artwork and is not covered by the repository's MIT software license. Archives, textures, converted GLBs and source-derived route data remain in ignored local `assets/` or `evidence/` directories. The public repository retains its procedural fallback.

The tools use the existing local HTTP server and installed Three.js/Playwright/Chrome. They do not download assets, publish anything or change a gameplay manifest. Start the normal development server before invoking them. Default conversion origin is `http://localhost:8080`; override with `KART_BUILD_ORIGIN`.

## Mario and Standard Kart

`node games/mario-kart/pipeline/build-source.mjs`

Inputs are the extracted Mario, Standard Kart and Standard Tire archives under `games/mario-kart/evidence/asset-study/`, or a corresponding server URL supplied as `KART_SOURCE_URL`. Source pages and submitter credits are recorded in the output provenance JSON. The converter corrects pupil overlays, poses the skeleton, assigns kart paint/emblem textures and makes four independent wheel pivots with the source tire emission mask. The runtime preserves source rim geometry and applies its own smooth antigravity material/tilt behavior. Outputs `assets/mario-kart/mario-source.glb` and a provenance/hash sidecar. The original generated models remain present as separate local files. The current local manifest selects source conversions for all eight racers.

## Seven additional racers

`node games/mario-kart/pipeline/build-source-rivals.mjs`

Optional arguments select individual IDs: `luigi peach yoshi toad bowser donkey-kong koopa`. Inputs are extracted local driver folders, plus the same kart/tire folders as Mario. The converter preserves the proven source chassis and independent tire pivots, selects each driver's paint and emblem, and fits an observed Y-up skeleton into a seated pose. Texture repetition is necessary: Luigi's body and Koopa's eye UVs extend outside the unit square. Pupil overlays are hidden because the eye atlases include pupils. Yoshi's extended rest-pose tongue is retracted; Peach's hair, skirt and hidden legs are fitted to the seat. These poses and proportions are art-directed, not Nintendo animations.

Outputs are `<id>-source.glb` and provenance sidecars with source-page/archive records, input and converter hashes, shared asset credits and output hashes. Conversion itself does not alter the manifest. The local manifest was selected after three-angle exported-model review; prior selection is preserved under ignored `evidence/asset-study/before-rivals-45/`.

`node games/mario-kart/pipeline/review-source-rivals.mjs` captures all eight exported models from front, rear and side and checks runtime head/wheel metadata. `EVIDENCE_DIR` overrides its output folder. A studio review is separate from the full keyboard race and its loaded-byte verification.

## Mario Kart Stadium

`node games/mario-kart/pipeline/build-source-stadium.mjs`

Defaults to the extracted OBJ, MTL and textures in `games/mario-kart/evidence/asset-study/stadium/`. Override its filesystem directory with `KART_STADIUM_DIR` and matching server URL with `KART_STADIUM_URL`. The folder must contain the archive's `Mario Kart Stadium.obj` and `.mtl` plus original textures.

The builder runs `source-road.py` using Python's standard library to recover the actual road center from mesh UV intersections. It validates unbranched topology and ordered landmark seams, preserves the explicit launch gap, and samples positions/normals. `source-surface.py` then attaches the actual indexed ground triangles, normals, road classification and boost-panel masks. Runtime support queries use these triangles through a spatial grid; width queries preserve separate road branches while joining narrow divider strips. `KART_STADIUM_ROUTE` may supply a precomputed route instead. The material conversion resolves filename capitalization, adds normal/emissive maps, preserves cutout alpha, and hides the opaque shadow-only proxy mesh and two misplaced light component groups through `source-visible.js`. Roof light geometry remains visible. The runtime applies the same exclusions to previously converted packs. GLB vertex welding preserves UV and normal seams.

Outputs `assets/mario-kart/stadium-source.glb`, `stadium-route.json` and `stadium-source.provenance.json`. Provenance includes all input file hashes, converter hashes, source page and credits. The ignored local manifest now selects this course through `course: {model: "stadium-source.glb", route: "stadium-route.json"}`. Runtime driving, contacts and the chase camera use its measured three-dimensional surface. `?sourceCourse=0` selects the original course; a missing or invalid optional pack falls back automatically.

`node games/mario-kart/pipeline/review-source-stadium.mjs` reloads the exported GLB, measures independent ray intersections for all non-air route samples, and captures 14 poses under `games/mario-kart/evidence/asset-study/stadium-converted/`. This is a geometry verification, not a race or controller test. The source course has also completed a separately recorded real-keyboard race; see `../OVERNIGHT-LOOP.md`. Geometry verification alone is not gameplay acceptance.

Source asphalt uses its normal maps at strength 1.1 and an art-directed roughness approximation from the original SPM scalar: `0.56 - 0.26 * sqrt(scalar / 255)`. These particular source textures repeat their scalar in RGBA; the converter reads alpha to avoid Canvas premultiplication loss. The exported green roughness channels were independently compared pixel-for-pixel against the original PNGs. This does not reproduce Nintendo’s shader. `source-materials.js` also applies emission levels to the original masked lamps and windows.

Physical ground includes the source `fc_shiba` turf banks as off-road surfaces. A recorded final-corner failure identified visible grass about 1.8 m above the old fallback plane. The corrected ground mesh contains 12,162 triangles and 12,056 vertices. Independent exported-mesh rays now verify the two actual failed contact positions as well as the ordinary route samples. Regenerating only route geometry leaves the GLB unchanged; its provenance sidecar records a separate route revision and hash.

## Stadium TV surfaces and branding

`source-screens.js` corrects V coordinates only on the imported `fc_TV_MKTV` and `fc_TV_capture` surfaces at runtime. Their physical upper vertices have source V=0, which inverted both the source bitmap and the GPU race feed. Other signs and the GLB on disk remain unchanged. `node games/mario-kart/source-screen-review.mjs` renders a labeled calibration card through bitmap and render-target paths, samples corners derived from physical world-space height, and verifies the correction is idempotent.

`python3 games/mario-kart/pipeline/build-source-tv.py` packs the 49 locally supplied `mktv.<n>.png` frames into an edge-padded atlas and writes input/output hashes and layout metadata. It does not select the atlas automatically. The ignored local manifest now supplies its descriptor through `course.tvBrand`. The runtime validates layout dimensions, uses one texture, plays the source introduction and loops the completed logo's signal animation. Timing is art-directed at 20 frames per second. Missing/invalid optional branding retains the source bitmap. Generated scenery is unaffected. The snapshot tool includes asset PNGs so browser-loaded atlas bytes are verified alongside code and GLBs.

`?sourceCourse=1` prefers the full local manifest descriptor, including optional branding, and uses the conventional source filenames only when no descriptor exists. `?sourceCourse=0` keeps the generated course. `node games/mario-kart/source-pack-review.mjs` exercises both selection paths and a deliberately unavailable atlas in actual browser sessions. New race reports retain the fetched asset manifest; verification requires any selected TV atlas to have been loaded successfully and to match the preserved hash.
